Hi there, thanks for your feedback!
Several changes suggested I didn't make from the last feedback:
1. Legenda order

The legenda is originally ordered in a descending format. It can be considered as a ranking. That means the first label had the highest ratio of delayed flights. This consists with the main title and story I'm telling, how flights delay. The colors have already provide a good visual encoding, readers won't be confused.I think it's OK to change, but better not to. 

2. All months view in the bar on the right side.
It dosen't make a lot of sense to sum up. There's no fixed pattern of Day of Month. The pattern only exsits when we combine the day with month. For example, 
we can only see day 15~24 peaks in December. That's because of the Christmas. Another reason that I put the day variables there was to help readers find the day of their interests.

3. Changes in day and night.
It can be interesting to know how flights delay differently day and night. However, I would say that could be further elaborated in another story. I'll update a whole new chart if time allows. In terms of the length of the day, as I've mentioned in the README.md, if only one meric to choose from to tell the story, the best choice (I can think of) is to give a ratio(reference as probability) with certain delay time(that they can refer to).

Thanks for reading me! Have a nice day :)
